I am a Software Engineer turned DevOps Engineer. I grew up learning about computers from my IT Director father. Computers and technology has become my biggest passion and hobby and I feel amazingly lucky to have my biggest passion as my day job.
I&amp;rsquo;m always learning new things and this blog is going to be my main platform for sharing what I learn. I&amp;rsquo;ll be covering topics ranging from software development in C#, Rust, TypeScript, to CICD tools, to Docker and Kubernetes, to HomeLabbing, and much much more.</description></item></channel></rss>
