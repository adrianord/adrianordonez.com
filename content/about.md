Hello, my name is Adrian Ordonez. I am a Software Engineer turned DevOps Engineer. I grew up learning about computers
from my IT Director father. Computers and technology has become my biggest passion and hobby and I feel amazingly lucky
to have my biggest passion as my day job.

I'm always learning new things and this blog is going to be my main platform for sharing what I learn. I'll be covering
topics ranging from software development in C#, Rust, TypeScript, to CICD tools, to Docker and Kubernetes, to
HomeLabbing, and much much more. Just generally anything that catches my eye at the time.

If you're interested in interacting, checkout my [Twitter] and my [GitHub]. This blog is the first step into me being
much more active on social media and interacting with the community and I cannot wait to meet new people and learn more!
